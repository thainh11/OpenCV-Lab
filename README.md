# OpenCV Lab 

## Introduction

Welcome to the OpenCV Lab project! This repository contains the code and resources for a computer vision laboratory that I completed as part of my school coursework. The project focuses on using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning library, to explore various image processing and computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

In this lab, we delve into the fundamentals of computer vision using OpenCV. The project is structured into different modules, each addressing a specific aspect of image processing and computer vision. The modules include:

1. **Image Processing Basics:** Introduction to basic image operations, such as loading images, color space conversions, and basic filtering.

2. **Feature Detection and Matching:** Exploring keypoint detection, feature matching, and image alignment using OpenCV functions.

3. **Object Detection:** Implementing object detection using pre-trained models and exploring techniques like Haar cascades.

4. **Image Segmentation:** Understanding image segmentation techniques, such as thresholding, contour detection, and watershed algorithm.

5. **Camera Calibration:** Calibrating a camera using OpenCV for geometric corrections and obtaining accurate measurements from images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenCV-Lab.git
```

### Running the Code

Navigate to the project directory and run the Python scripts for each module:

```bash
cd OpenCV-Lab
python module1_image_processing.py
```

Repeat the above command for each module, replacing the script name accordingly.
