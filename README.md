# OpenCV Lab 

## Introduction

Welcome to the OpenCV Lab project! This repository contains the code and resources for a computer vision laboratory that I completed as part of my school coursework. The project focuses on using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning library, to explore various image processing and computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

In this lab, we delve into the fundamentals of computer vision using OpenCV. The project is structured into different modules, each addressing a specific aspect of image processing and computer vision. The modules include:

1. **Image Processing Basics:** Introduction to basic image operations, such as loading images, color space conversions, and basic filtering.

2. **Drawing rectangle using console:** Discovery the location of the ponit. You can draw the rectangle and rotate it.

3. **Process image with console:** Changing the color channel with console and visualize the result .

4. **Hough Transform:** Understanding hough transform algorithm.

5. **Algorithms combinaation:** Understanding the snake, watershed, kmeans and mean shift segmentation.

6.  **Image Alignment using RANSAC with streamlit:** Do the alignment image with streamlit plattform.

7.  **Stitching two image with console:** Do stitching for 2 image

8.  **Face Detection:** Understanding basic face detection algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
